# E-commerce Back End

## Project Description:
In this project I was responsible for developing/refactoring the back end of an E-Commerce site. This project contains Express.js and Sequelize. Sequelize is used to interact with MySql database. I then display different routes in my demonstration using Insomnia.

## Installation:
To install please follow these steps: </br>
* 1.) Clone this repository onto their device.<br>
* 2.) Install all packages my opening up the integrated terminal and typing <b>"npm i"</b>. <br>
* 3.) Now you have to connect to the data base. To do this type <b>"mysql -u root -p"</b>. When asked for password, type in your MySql password. Then use the <u>ecommerce_db</u>. <br>
* 4.) Next open up another terminal and seed the data. You can do this by typing in <b>"npm run seed"</b>. This will seed your database.<br>
* 5.) Now all you have to do is start the server. To do this open up an intergrated terminal and type <b>"npm start"</b>.

## Usage:
This program allows the user to update, delete, view, and create different categories, products, and tags.<br>
